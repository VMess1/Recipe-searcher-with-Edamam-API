# Recipe-searcher-with-Edamam-API
First ever practice program using Edamam API. No GUI interface at present
Programme allows for searching for recipes with optional selection to refine search results.
Allows for saving the recipes to a .txt file
GUI to be added in due course to practice using Tkinter 
To be refined and added to in future.

My first ever practice at making a basic program
